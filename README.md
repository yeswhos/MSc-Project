The Zumo robot wrestling league is a popular league internationally. This project will see you design a control system for an autonomous robot which is capable of wrestling another robot (See youtube). The objective is to push the other robot out of the ring (sumo wrestling style). This objective raises a number of challenging problems such as finding your opponent, tactics to outmaneuver them, and how to push them out of the ring.  The project will see the development of a framework for Zumo battles.


Each student will be provided with a Zumo robot and all equipment to complete the project. All students taking this project will be entered into the School of Computing Zumo wrestling league and will be expected to present their fighting robot during the Student Showcase.


There is scope in this project to develop teaching/instructional resources for use during educational outreach activities organised by the School of Computing.
